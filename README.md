# Superstore Sales Analysis Using PowerBi

In This Project, I was tasked with analyzing sales data to identify trends and make recommendations for improving sales performance. I chose to use Microsoft PowerBI for this project due to its robust capabilities in data visualization and analysis.

First, I gathered data from multiple sources including Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases  and then I imported this data into PowerBI.Once the data was imported, I used PowerBI's data transformation features to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involved tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and merging datasets to create comprehensive views of the sales data.

Next, I created various visualizations using PowerBI's wide range of chart types and interactive elements. For example, I created bar charts to compare sales performance across different product categories, line charts to visualize trends over time, and geographic maps to identify high-performing regions.
